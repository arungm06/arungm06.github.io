### Favorite CPSC 120 Labs
 
* Lab 3, Part 2
    I really enjoyed this part of Lab 3 because it allowed me to spend more time trying to solve the problems with our errors with my partner. I enjoyed learning about how to differentiate dates and using the Fliegel & Van Flandern's algorithm in our code to help convert into Julian days. It has also helped improve my ability to define functions.

* Lab 6, Part 2
    I enjoyed this part of Lab 6 because it was a very interesting instruction to create a Black Jack simulation. It also was a very challenging code file, which made it very intriguing to figure out. I had learned how to properly use “if” statements and how to implement parameters to the defined code.

* Lab 10, Part 1
    I really enjoyed this part of Lab 10 because it showed me what tools are needed and how counties are separated based on population. It wasn't the most challenging, but working with my partner had helped me learn more about the functions and statements that were used. This was my most favorite because I was able to learn new things and solve challenging code quickly.
